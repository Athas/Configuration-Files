Some programs expect their configuration files in a specific location,
such as in your home directory, or a subfolder.  The mklinks.sh script
creates symlinks from these expected locations to your central
configuration file reposiroty.

Put the contents of this directory in your XDG_CONFIG_HOME directory
(defaults to ~/.config).  Then run the mklinks.sh script while
standing in your home directory, and symlinks to the configuration
files should be created.

Note that the above will create a lot of links, far more than you
likely need - it may be better to inspect the script manually, and
edit it to only create the links that you need.  Also note that links
are not created for programs that are more flexible (or unusual) in
their configuration file requirements.
